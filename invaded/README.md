# Invaded

Earth is under attack by aliens.  You are the last space pilot left.  If you fail to stop them they will take over the Earth.

This is a slap together shoot'em up.  This has the follow features:

* Simple hit feedback
* Movement
* Shields
* Three alien types
* Programable Wave system
* Speech (thanks to Bikibird - https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=116607)
* Windowing (thanks to Lazy Dev - https://www.youtube.com/c/LazyDevs)
* Starfields (thanks to Lazy Dev - https://www.youtube.com/c/LazyDevs)

Since I see no licenses from Bikibird or Lazy Dev, and this was more of experiment than a real game I'm releasing this into the public domain.
